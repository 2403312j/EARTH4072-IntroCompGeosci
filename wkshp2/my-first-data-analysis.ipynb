    "*This notebook was created by Martin Hurst and updated by Tobias Keller, University of Glasgow.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will run a simple data analysis of a time series of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in Earth's atmosphere recorded at the [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/) on Hawaii. The Intended Learning Outcomes of this lab are:\n",
    "* Understand how to plot and manipulate a data set in `Python`\n",
    "* Get to know how to import and use modules in `Python`\n",
    "* Familiarise yourself with important concepts in data analysis\n",
    "* Examine the changing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere through time\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside blocks of `Python` code there are comments indicated by lines that start with `#`. These lines are not computer code but rather comments providing information about what the code is doing to help you follow along. \n",
    "\n",
    "Work through the notebook by executing (`shift + enter`) each cell in sequence from the top. At various points you will be asked to edit or complete the code for you to learn how things are done by doing them yourself. Please ___read carefully all text instructions as well as all code and comments within___. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use a web search engine of your choice to look up any `Python` commands you don't understand. There's typically good documentation around.\n",
    "\n",
    "At times the `Python` engine running the notebook in the background may get stuck. You can tell by tags to the left of code cells showing `[*]`. If that happens, select the 'restart' button (circular arrow) from the menu bar at the top of the window, or select 'Kernel -> Restart' from the menu bar above. After restarting the kernel you will need to ___execute all cells again from the top___ to continue where you left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to tell `Python` which tools we want to use. Many useful modules have been written for `Python` users. These can be loaded at the top of a script with an `import` command. In fact, one of the reasons `Python` is such a widely adopted language is that it is quite straightforward to program and distribute additional modules with useful functionality. Here, we are going to use a few of the most frequently used ones: `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`."
