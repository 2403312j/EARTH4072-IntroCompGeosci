    "* create and explain figures and plots that visualise model behaviour\n",

    "## Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will implement a numerical model for intrusive contact heating of crustal rocks and concurrent cooling of the magma intrusion that provides the source of heat. We will be solving a so-called partial differential equation (PDE, has derivatives of both time and space) based on the fundamental principle of energy conservation. The model will represent the lateral flow of heat from a hot intrusion into cooler country rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will represent a rock layer conceptualised as a horizontal 1-D profile into a vertically homogeneous crustal layer, reaching from the contact with a hot intrusion out into cooler country rock. To discretise the model, we split up the rock layer into discrete volume elements that will act like a row of storage heaters. The model will track the temperature (i.e., heat content) in each of these volume cells and compute the flux of heat that flows horizontally across the faces between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the only input of heat is the intrusion itself, and the only output is the conductive loss of heat towards the cool country rock at the end of the model layer. We assume there is no vertical flow of heat in or out of the model layer, representing a vertically homogeneous crustal section. The heat added by the intrusion and lost to the country rock are two ___boundary conditions___ we will impose on either side of our 1-D model domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the ___fundamental principle of energy conservation___, we can express the governing equation for the evolving temperature (i.e., heat content) with distance from the intrusion, $x$ [m], and time, $t$ [s], as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    {{d T(x,t)}\\over{dt}}=-{{dq(x,t)}\\over{dx}} \\ , \\tag{1} \\label{eq:1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the rate of change in rock temperature $T(x,t)$ [$^\\circ$C] is given by the spatial gradient in the heat flux $q(x,t)$ [$^\\circ$C/m$^2$/s]. Meaning that if there is a change in the flux of heat with distance, $dq/dx$, this has to be balanced by a change in heat content expressed as temperature $T$. In our analogy from before, if more heat enters one side of a \"storage heater\" cell than leaves out the other, the stored heat amount in that cell must increase, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown both by experiment and from theory that, according to ___Fourier's law of heat conduction___, the heat flux $q$ can be expressed as the product of the thermal diffusivity $K_0$ [m$^2$/s] and the spatial gradient in temperature $dT / dx$,\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this law is that ___heat flows from high temperature to low temperature, at the rate allowed by the materials heat diffusivity___. By substituting \\eqref{eq:2} into the conservation equation \\eqref{eq:1} we get to the final governing equation for our model,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    {{d T(x,t)}\\over{dt}} = K_0 {{d^2 T(x,t)}\\over{dx^2}} \\ . \\tag{5} \\label{eq:5}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume for now that the diffusivity $K_0$ is constant and therefore moved it out and in front of the spatial derivatives. Combining the two spatial derivatives on the right hand side means that the rate of temperature evolution now depends on the ___second derivative___ of temperature in space, also known as the ___Laplacian___ of temperature, $d^2 T/dx^2$. This is an important mathematical operation that comes up frequently in physics-based  modelling of geological processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thermal diffusivity of rock is typically around $10^{-6}$ m$^2$/s. That is quite a small number, indicating that heat flow in the crust will be reasonably slow on human time scales (days to years); instead, it takes place over geological time (thousand to millions of years)."

    "You should now have a fully functioning and numerically stable model for intrusive contact heating. So far, we've only looked at how heat from an adjacent intrusion spreads into the cooler wall rock. We set the intrusion temperature to be constant (left boundary), meaning that heat will continue flowing out into the crust as long as we keep the model running. In reality, this could only be the case if the intrusion is very large and therefore has sufficient heat to maintain a constant temperature despite continually loosing heat into the surrounding crust.\n",
    "\n",
    "That will not normally be the case in nature. Rather, intrusions come in all sizes and shapes. Often, they take the shape of magma-filled fractures or dykes of no more than a few metres thickness. Clearly, the amount of heat they can transfer into the crust is limited, meaning that they won't go on heating the crust indefinitely but will cool down themselves in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "That, by the way, is exactly the meaning of the fundamental principle of ___energy conservation___: There is a limited amount of energy in natural systems. All natural processes can do is to redistribute that finite amount of energy. They tend to do that in a way that more eveny distributes the heat, thereby ___raising the entropy in the system___. You may recall that entropy is the degree of disorder or randomness in natural system. Having all heat in the intrusion and none in the crust is a \"highly ordered\" state, whereas having it evenly spread out is comparatively \"disordered\". Any natural process ___will exactly conserve the total amount of energy originally in the system___ (initial condition) and ___exactly account for all energy passing between the system and its environment___ (boundary conditions).\n",
